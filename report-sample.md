## Status Report Sample - This Will Become The Title ######

Contact: John Smith, <test@FreeBSD.org>

Introduce your work.  Do not assume that the person reading
the report knows about your project.  Paragraphs are separated
with an empty line.

Show the importance of your work.  Status reports are not
just about telling everyone that things were done, they also
need to explain why they were done.  Use Markdown syntax,
the same you use on GitHub.

What has happened since the last report?  Let us know what
is new in this area.  If you don't know Markdown, just write
it as if it was plain text.

Optionally include the information about the sponsor.

If help is needed, make this explicit.  List tasks, with enough
detail that people know if they are likely to be able to do them,
and invite people to get in contact:

  * First task
  * Second task
  * Third, if any
