FreeBSD Quarterly Status Reports
================================

This is the working repo for FreeBSD Status Reports.  To submit
your own report:

1. Fork the repository; reusing an old fork is fine
2. Go into the directory for the current status report - `2018q3`
3. Create a new file, with name corresponding to the
   name of your project.  Please use the `report-sample.md`
   as a template.
4. Create a Pull Request

Please submit your reports as early as you can.  You can edit
your report after submitting it; just edit it and submit another PR.

Don't worry too much about the Markdown syntax or language errors - we
will fix it for you.

Deadline for submitting Status Reports for the third quarter of 2018
is 2018-10-31.
